# Ashes Standard Library

This document summarizes the current compiler-provided standard-library surface.
It is user-facing guidance for the shipped modules; the authoritative language
semantics remain in `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`.

## Built-in Runtime Types

These types are always available without imports:

- `Unit`
- `Maybe(T)` with constructors `None` and `Some(T)`
- `Result(E, A)` with constructors `Error(E)` and `Ok(A)`
- `List<T>` as the type shown for list syntax and list values
- `Socket`
- `TlsSocket`
- `Process`
- `FileHandle`

## Built-in Modules

### `Ashes.IO`

- `print(value)` returning `Unit` — write a printable scalar (`Int`, `Str`, or `Bool`) to stdout, followed by a newline
- `panic(message)` returning `a` — print `message` and abort the program; never returns, so it is usable at any type
- `args` returning `List(Str)` — the command-line arguments passed to the program
- `write(text)` returning `Unit` — write `text` to stdout with no trailing newline
- `writeLine(text)` returning `Unit` — write `text` to stdout followed by a newline
- `readLine()` returning `Maybe(Str)`
- `readExact(n)` returning `Result(Str, Str)` — read exactly `n` bytes from stdin

### `Ashes.File`

- `readText(path)` returning `Result(Str, Str)` — UTF-8-validated; caps at 1 MiB.
- `readAllBytes(path)` returning `Result(Str, Bytes)` — read a whole file into a `Bytes` with no UTF-8
  validation. Uncapped on Linux (the buffer is a standalone `mmap`, so it can exceed one arena chunk);
  on Windows it currently shares the `readText` buffer and so caps at the same 1 MiB. The buffer is
  read-only and program-lifetime; fields sliced from it (`Bytes.subText`) are copied into the arena.
- `mmap(path)` returning `Result(Str, Bytes)` — memory-map a file read-only and return a **zero-copy**
  `Bytes` **view** over the mapping (no read, no copy). On Linux the pages fault in on access, so a
  data-parallel fold that touches different chunks faults them in **in parallel**, and the mapping is
  shared read-only across worker threads. The mapping is program-lifetime, so slices/views into it stay
  valid. On Windows this falls back to the capped `readAllBytes` read. Preferred over `readAllBytes` for
  random-access / chunked processing (e.g. `challenges/1brc/brc_parallel.ash`).
- `writeText(path, text)` returning `Result(Str, Unit)`
- `writeBytes(path, bytes)` returning `Result(Str, Unit)`
- `exists(path)` returning `Result(Str, Bool)`
- `open(path)` returning `Result(Str, FileHandle)` — open a file for reading; the handle is a
  resource type, automatically closed when it goes out of scope.
- `readChunk(fh)(maxBytes)` returning `Result(Str, Str)` — read up to `maxBytes` bytes;
  returns `Ok("")` at end of file. Lets a large file be streamed without loading it whole (cf.
  `readText`, which allocates the entire file at once).
- `readLine(fh)` returning `Maybe(Str)` — read one line (the trailing `\n`, and a preceding
  `\r`, are stripped) through a refillable module-global buffer; returns `None` at end of file. Unlike
  `readChunk` it threads no buffer state through the caller, so a whole-file fold can be a **single**
  loop carrying only its accumulator — which is what keeps such a fold constant-memory (a per-chunk
  re-entry structure re-copies a reuse accumulator each chunk). The buffer is guarded by the handle it
  holds: calling `readLine` on a different handle resets it (any read-ahead for the previous handle is
  discarded), so it is for reading one file to completion, not interleaving line-reads across handles.
- `close(fh)` returning `Result(Str, Unit)` — close explicitly (also automatic on scope exit).

### `Ashes.Bytes`

An immutable byte sequence with O(1) indexed access and O(1) length.

- `empty()` returning `Bytes` — empty byte sequence
- `singleton(byte)` returning `Bytes` — one-byte sequence
- `length(bytes)` returning `Int`
- `get(bytes, index)` returning `u8` — panics if index out of bounds
- `indexOf(bytes)(needle)(from)` returning `Int` — index of the first byte equal to `needle` (an
  `Int` byte value) at or after `from`, or `-1` if none. O(len − from), no allocation — a memchr for
  scanning a buffer by integer position without materializing views.
- `compare(left)(right)` returning `Int` — three-way lexicographic byte order, normalized to
  `-1`/`0`/`1`. One `memcmp` over the common prefix plus a length tie-break — far faster than a
  byte-at-a-time loop. With `fromText` this underlies `Ashes.String.compare`.
- `subText(bytes)(start)(len)` returning `Str` — copy `len` bytes starting at `start` into a fresh
  `Str`. O(len); the range is clamped into the source so it never reads out of bounds. The caller
  must ensure the range lies on valid UTF-8 boundaries (slicing at ASCII delimiters like `;`/`\n`
  always does). With `indexOf` this lets a buffer be scanned by integer index instead of a shrinking
  `Str` view.
- `subView(bytes)(start)(len)` returning `Str` — a zero-copy VIEW over the same range `subText`
  would copy (O(1), no byte copy; same clamping and UTF-8 caveat). The backing bytes must outlive
  the view: a view over an `Ashes.File.mmap` mapping is valid for the program's lifetime, and a
  view stored into a structure (e.g. a `Map` key) is materialized by the copy-out/blob paths.
  Prefer it for transient per-record slices in hot scan loops.
- `append(left, right)` returning `Bytes` — concatenate two sequences
- `appendByte(bytes, byte)` returning `Bytes` — append one byte
- `fromList(list)` returning `Bytes` — convert `List(u8)` to `Bytes`
- `fromText(text)` returning `Bytes` — expose a `Str`'s UTF-8 bytes (O(1); `Str` and `Bytes`
  share an in-memory layout). Byte order over the result equals Unicode codepoint order, so this is
  the basis for a correct string ordering (see `Ashes.String.compare`).
- `hash(bytes)` returning `Int` — 64-bit FNV-1a hash of the byte payload. With `fromText` this
  gives string hashing; it underlies `Ashes.HashMap`.
- `u16Le(value)` returning `Bytes` — encode `u16` little-endian (2 bytes)
- `u32Le(value)` returning `Bytes` — encode `u32` little-endian (4 bytes)
- `u64Le(value)` returning `Bytes` — encode `u64` little-endian (8 bytes)
- `getU16Le(bytes, offset)` returning `u16` — decode little-endian `u16` at offset
- `getU32Le(bytes, offset)` returning `u32` — decode little-endian `u32` at offset
- `getU64Le(bytes, offset)` returning `u64` — decode little-endian `u64` at offset

### `Ashes.UInt`

- `toInt(value)` returning `Int` — widen an unsigned integer (`u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64`) to a signed
  `Int`. Value-preserving for `u8`/`u16`/`u32` (and a bit-reinterpret for `u64`); it is the bridge that
  lets a byte from `Ashes.Bytes.get` be used in `Int` arithmetic, enabling byte-level integer parsing
  without routing through strings.

### `Ashes.Text`

- `uncons(text)` returning `Maybe((Str, Str))`
- `parseInt(text)` returning `Result(Str, Int)`
- `parseFloat(text)` returning `Result(Str, Float)`
- `fromInt(value)` returning `Str`
- `fromFloat(value)` returning `Str`
- `formatFloat(value)(decimals)` returning `Str` — fixed-precision decimal formatting: exactly
  `decimals` fractional digits, trailing zeros kept (`formatFloat(1.5)(9)` is `1.500000000`,
  `formatFloat(2.5)(0)` is `3`). `decimals` is clamped to the range 0–18. Rounding is
  half-away-from-zero on the magnitude. Magnitudes too large for the fixed path fall back to the
  same scientific notation as `fromFloat`.
- `toHex(value)` returning `Str`
- `byteLength(text)` returning `Int` — UTF-8 byte length of a string
 
### `Ashes.Process`

Synchronous subprocess control with piped stdin/stdout/stderr.
`Process` is a resource type; it is automatically closed when it goes out of scope.

- `spawn(exe)(args)` returning `Result(Str, Process)` — launch `exe` with argument list `args`
- `writeStdin(proc)(text)` returning `Unit` — write bytes to the process's stdin pipe
- `readStdoutLine(proc)` returning `Maybe(Str)` — read one line from stdout (`None` on EOF)
- `readStderrLine(proc)` returning `Maybe(Str)` — read one line from stderr (`None` on EOF)
- `waitForExit(proc)` returning `Int` — block until the process exits, return its exit code
- `kill(proc)` returning `Unit` — send SIGTERM (Linux) or `TerminateProcess` (Windows)

Supported on Linux x64, Linux arm64, and Windows x64.

### `Ashes.Http`

- `get(url)` returning `Task(Str, Str)`
- `post(url, body)` returning `Task(Str, Str)`

All networking APIs return `Task(...)` and are consumed with `await`.

Current HTTP support is intentionally small:

- `http://` and `https://` URLs are supported.
- `https://` defaults to port 443 and currently ships on the Linux x64,
  Linux arm64, and Windows x64 backends via the hermetic `rustls`
  runtime embedded into TLS-using executables.
- Other backends may still return a runtime error for `https://` until their
  TLS runtime support lands.
- Responses are expected to be plain HTTP/1.1 responses terminated by connection close.
- `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` currently returns `Error("unsupported transfer encoding")`.

### `Ashes.Net.Tcp`

- `connect(host)(port)` returning `Task(Str, Socket)`
- `send(socket)(text)` returning `Task(Str, Int)`
- `receive(socket)(maxBytes)` returning `Task(Str, Str)`
- `close(socket)` returning `Task(Str, Unit)`

### `Ashes.Net.Tls`

- `connect(host)(port)` returning `Task(Str, TlsSocket)`
- `send(socket)(text)` returning `Task(Str, Int)`
- `receive(socket)(maxBytes)` returning `Task(Str, Str)`
- `close(socket)` returning `Task(Str, Unit)`

`Ashes.Net.Tls` uses the same TLS runtime path as `https://` in `Ashes.Http`.
On Linux x64, Linux arm64, and Windows x64 that currently means the
hermetic `rustls` runtime embedded per TLS-using executable. No
external OpenSSL installation is required. Hostname verification and
system-trust validation are mandatory for successful TLS connections.

## Shipped Helper Modules

These modules are compiler-shipped and live under the reserved `Ashes.*`
namespace. They are not overridable by project-local modules.

### `Ashes.List`

- `append` — `List(a) -> List(a) -> List(a)`, the elements of `left` followed by those of `right`
- `filter` — `(a -> Bool) -> List(a) -> List(a)`, the elements satisfying `predicate`, in order
- `foldLeft` — `(b -> a -> b) -> b -> List(a) -> b`, left fold from `initial` over the list
- `fold` — alias for `foldLeft`
- `head` — `List(a) -> Maybe(a)`, the first element, or `None` if empty
- `isEmpty` — `List(a) -> Bool`, whether the list has no elements
- `length` — `List(a) -> Int`, number of elements
- `map` — `(a -> b) -> List(a) -> List(b)`, apply `f` to each element
- `reverse` — `List(a) -> List(a)`, the elements in reverse order
- `tail` — `List(a) -> Maybe(List(a))`, all but the first element, or `None` if empty

### `Ashes.Math`

All functions are curried. Layer 1 is hermetic (no native payload). Layer 2
transcendentals are backed by a vendored openlibm compiled to LLVM bitcode and
linked into the program only when a transcendental is used, so hermetic-only
programs carry no math payload and there is never a runtime dependency. See the
*Math runtime model* in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the mechanism.

Integer:

- `abs(n)` returning `Int` — absolute value
- `signum(n)` returning `Int` — `-1`, `0`, or `1`
- `min(a)(b)` / `max(a)(b)` returning `Int`
- `clamp(lo)(hi)(n)` returning `Int` — `n` confined to `[lo, hi]`
- `gcd(a)(b)` returning `Int` — greatest common divisor (non-negative)
- `lcm(a)(b)` returning `Int` — least common multiple (non-negative; `0` if either is `0`)
- `divMod(a)(b)` returning `(Int, Int)` — Euclidean quotient and remainder (`0 <= r < |b|`)
- `pow(base)(exp)` returning `Int` — exponentiation by squaring (`exp >= 0`)
- `isqrt(n)` returning `Int` — integer (floor) square root (`n >= 0`)

Float:

- `absF(x)` / `signumF(x)` returning `Float`
- `minF(a)(b)` / `maxF(a)(b)` returning `Float`
- `clampF(lo)(hi)(x)` returning `Float`
- `sqrt(x)` returning `Float` — hardware square root (`llvm.sqrt`), no library
- `floor(x)` / `ceil(x)` / `round(x)` / `trunc(x)` returning `Float`
- `pi` / `e` / `tau` — `Float` constants

Conversions:

- `toFloat(n)` returning `Float` — widen an `Int`
- `floorToInt(x)` / `roundToInt(x)` / `truncToInt(x)` returning `Int` — narrow a `Float`

Transcendentals (Layer 2, openlibm-backed):

- Trigonometric: `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`, `asin(x)`, `acos(x)`, `atan(x)`, `atan2(y)(x)`
- Hyperbolic: `sinh(x)`, `cosh(x)`, `tanh(x)`
- Exponential / logarithmic: `exp(x)`, `expm1(x)`, `ln(x)`, `log2(x)`, `log10(x)`, `log1p(x)`
- Powers / roots: `powF(base)(exp)`, `cbrt(x)`, `hypot(x)(y)`
- Remainder: `fmod(x)(y)`

Domain errors follow IEEE-754 (`sqrt(-1.0)` is `NaN`), so the Float functions
stay total.

### `Ashes.Array`

Immutable indexed array backed by a persistent balanced tree.

- `empty` — empty immutable array
- `isEmpty(array)` returning `Bool`
- `length(array)` returning `Int`
- `get(index)(array)` returning `Maybe(T)` — `None` for out-of-bounds indices
- `set(index)(value)(array)` returning a new array (out-of-bounds indices leave the array unchanged)
- `append(value)(array)` returning a new array with value appended at the end
- `toList(array)` returning `List(T)` in index order
- `fromList(list)` returning a new array preserving input order

### `Ashes.Map`

- `empty` — empty immutable map
- `isEmpty(map)` returning `Bool` — whether the map has no entries
- `get(compare)(key)(map)` returning `Maybe(V)`
- `getStr(key)(map)` returning `Maybe(V)` — `Str`-keyed lookup ordered by UTF-8 byte order
  (`Ashes.Bytes.compare` inline; no comparator closure, so it is markedly faster than
  `get(Ashes.String.compare)`)
- `contains(compare)(key)(map)` returning `Bool`
- `set(compare)(key)(value)(map)` returning a new map value
- `setStr(key)(value)(map)` returning a new map value — `Str`-keyed `set`, same ordering and
  performance rationale as `getStr`
- `upsertStr(key)(missValue)(onHit)(map)` returning a new map value — single-traversal
  insert-or-update: inserts `missValue` when `key` is absent, else replaces the stored value with
  `onHit(oldValue)`. Halves the tree work of a `getStr`-then-`setStr` pair in accumulation loops.
- `insert(compare)(key)(value)(map)` returning a new map value
- `size(map)` returning `Int`
- `foldLeft(folder)(state)(map)` returning the folded state in key order
- `toList(map)` returning `List((K, V))` in key order
- `fromList(compare)(entries)` returning a new map value

`Ashes.Map` is implemented as a persistent AVL tree. Because Ashes does not yet
have a built-in ordering abstraction, callers supply a total ordering function
`(K -> K -> Int)` to lookup and update helpers.

### `Ashes.HashTrie`

A persistent 16-ary hash trie keyed by `Str` — the constant-factor alternative to `Ashes.Map`
for large keyed accumulations. Each internal node carries its own nibble shift, so a lookup or
upsert costs ~4-5 dependent node loads at tens of thousands of keys (vs ~17 for the AVL
`Ashes.Map`), at the price of hash iteration order (re-sort at the end when ordered output is
needed). Keys compare by UTF-8 bytes at the leaf; equal-hash collisions chain through the leaf.
Update loops get the same in-place reuse specialization as `Map.set`, so hot folds are
constant-memory.

- `empty` — empty trie
- `hashText(text)` returning `Int` — the key hash (`Ashes.Bytes.hash` of the UTF-8 bytes);
  compute once per key and pass to the operations below
- `upsertHashed(hash)(key)(missValue)(onHit)(trie)` returning a new trie — single-traversal
  insert-or-update: inserts `missValue` when absent, else replaces the stored value with
  `onHit(oldValue)`
- `getHashed(hash)(key)(trie)` returning `Maybe(V)`
- `foldLeft(folder)(state)(trie)` returning the folded state (hash order, not key order)
- `toList(trie)` returning `List((K, V))` in hash order
- `size(trie)` returning `Int`

### `Ashes.Parallel`

Structured, deterministic parallelism over **pure** functions (see
`docs/future/COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION.md`). Every result is identical to the sequential
equivalent. `both` is a **genuinely parallel** fork/join primitive on all three targets
(per-thread arenas + worker threads + deep-copy-on-join), forking at concrete result types
and running sequentially for abstract ones. `map`/`reduce` fork at concrete element types via
call-site monomorphization, degrading to a (correct) sequential evaluation when used polymorphically
or partially applied.

- `both(left)(right)` returning `(A, B)` — fork/join two pure thunks `(Unit -> A)`, `(Unit -> B)`
- `map(f)(list)` returning `List(B)` — order-preserving map, split-and-fork shaped
- `reduce(combine)(identity)(f)(list)` returning `B` — parallel map-then-fold for associative
  `combine` (the shard-and-merge shape for data-parallel aggregation)
- `mapGrained(grain)(f)(list)` / `reduceGrained(grain)(combine)(identity)(f)(list)` — the same
  operations with an explicit **grain size**: shards of `grain` elements or fewer are processed
  sequentially instead of split further, trading split overhead against parallelism. `map`/`reduce`
  are exactly `mapGrained(1)` / `reduceGrained(1)`. The result is always identical to the sequential
  equivalent, whatever the grain (grains `< 1` behave as `1`).

#### Chunking a byte buffer

- `splitChunks(bytes)(sep)(n)` returning `List((Bytes, Int, Int))` — split `bytes` into up to `n`
  contiguous `(bytes, lo, hi)` sub-ranges, each ending just after an occurrence of the record
  separator byte `sep`, so no record straddles a chunk boundary (the last chunk runs to the buffer
  end). It is the record-boundary chunker for the data-parallel byte-scan pattern: feed the result
  straight to `reduce` — `reduce(merge)(identity)(foldChunk)(splitChunks(bytes)(sep)(n))` — so the
  `reduce` call stays at the caller's concrete result type and genuinely forks. `splitChunks` itself
  is pure and does the boundary-aligned splitting only (no parallel work).

#### Scoped worker overrides

`--parallel-workers` sets the executable's **compiled maximum** (its hard ceiling, or the detected
core count when unset). A program can request **fewer** workers for a specific computation with a
dynamically-scoped override; the effective count is `min(override, compiledMax)`, so a request
above the ceiling still clamps and one below it reduces the local limit. The override is restored
when the scope returns.

- `withWorkers(count)(action)` returning `A` — run the pure thunk `action : Unit -> A` with the
  worker cap scoped to `count` (clamped to the compiled maximum). `count` must be positive (a
  non-positive count panics). Nested `withWorkers` scopes apply the inner value inside and restore
  the outer on return. The result is identical to running `action` without the override — only the
  parallelism used to compute it changes.
- `bothWithWorkers(count)(left)(right)`, `mapWithWorkers(count)(f)(list)`,
  `mapGrainedWithWorkers(count)(grain)(f)(list)`, `reduceWithWorkers(count)(combine)(identity)(f)(list)`,
  `reduceGrainedWithWorkers(count)(grain)(combine)(identity)(f)(list)` — convenience wrappers, each
  equal to `withWorkers(count)` around the corresponding operation.

### `Ashes.Internal`

Compiler-foundation primitives (not intended for everyday use).

- `deepCopy(value)` returning the same type — an independent deep copy of any value (strings,
  tuples, lists, closures, and recursive ADTs such as `Map`/`HashMap`). Semantically the identity
  for immutable values; it underlies arena reclamation (FLAWS #2) and parallel result copy-out (#5).

### `Ashes.HashMap`

A persistent map keyed by `Str` that needs **no caller-supplied ordering**. Internally an
AVL tree ordered by the composite key `(FNV-1a hash, key)`, so navigation is dominated by
cheap 64-bit integer comparisons and only falls back to string comparison on a hash
collision. Same persistent-structure cost model as `Ashes.Map` (O(log K) nodes per update).

- `empty` — empty hash map
- `get(key)(map)` returning `Maybe(V)`
- `contains(key)(map)` returning `Bool`
- `set(key)(value)(map)` returning a new map
- `insert` — alias of `set`
- `size(map)` returning `Int`
- `foldLeft(folder)(state)(map)` returning the folded state (key order is by hash, not lexical)

### `Ashes.Maybe`

- `map` — `(a -> b) -> Maybe(a) -> Maybe(b)`, apply `f` to the contained value if `Some`
- `flatMap` — `(a -> Maybe(b)) -> Maybe(a) -> Maybe(b)`, apply `f` to the contained value, flattening
- `getOrElse` — `a -> Maybe(a) -> a`, the contained value, or `fallback` if `None`
- `default` — alias for `getOrElse`
- `unwrapOr` — alias for `getOrElse`
- `isSome` — `Maybe(a) -> Bool`, whether the value is `Some`
- `isNone` — `Maybe(a) -> Bool`, whether the value is `None`

### `Ashes.Result`

- `map` — `(a -> b) -> Result(e, a) -> Result(e, b)`, apply `f` to the `Ok` value
- `flatMap` — `(a -> Result(e, b)) -> Result(e, a) -> Result(e, b)`, apply `f` to the `Ok` value, flattening
- `bind` — alias for `flatMap`
- `mapError` — `(e -> f) -> Result(e, a) -> Result(f, a)`, apply `f` to the `Error` value
- `getOrElse` — `a -> Result(e, a) -> a`, the `Ok` value, or `fallback` if `Error`
- `default` — alias for `getOrElse`
- `isOk` — `Result(e, a) -> Bool`, whether the value is `Ok`
- `isError` — `Result(e, a) -> Bool`, whether the value is `Error`

### `Ashes.String`

- `length` — `Str -> Int`, number of characters
- `substring` — `Str -> Int -> Int -> Str`, `count` characters starting at index `start`
- `take` — `Str -> Int -> Str`, the first `count` characters
- `drop` — `Str -> Int -> Str`, all but the first `count` characters
- `indexOf` — `Str -> Str -> Int`, index of the first occurrence of `needle`, or `-1` if absent
- `startsWith` — `Str -> Str -> Bool`, whether `text` begins with `prefix`
- `contains` — `Str -> Str -> Bool`, whether `needle` occurs anywhere in `text`
- `split` — `Str -> Str -> List(Str)`, split `text` on each occurrence of `separator`
- `join` — `Str -> List(Str) -> Str`, concatenate `parts` with `separator` between them
- `trim` — `Str -> Str`, strip leading and trailing whitespace
- `trimStart` — `Str -> Str`, strip leading whitespace
- `trimEnd` — `Str -> Str`, strip trailing whitespace
- `isLetter` — `Str -> Bool`, whether the single character `text` is an ASCII letter (`a`–`z`, `A`–`Z`)
- `isDigit` — `Str -> Bool`, whether the single character `text` is a decimal digit (`0`–`9`)
- `isWhiteSpace` — `Str -> Bool`, whether the single character `text` is space, tab, newline, or carriage return
- `compare` — `Str -> Str -> Int` total order returning `-1`/`0`/`1`. Compares by UTF-8 bytes (via
  `Ashes.Bytes.fromText`), which equals Unicode codepoint order, so it is a correct total order over
  all strings — suitable directly as the ordering function for `Ashes.Map`/`Ashes.Array`.

### `Ashes.Json`

Full JSON value type and recursive-descent parser/serializer.

- **Type**: `Json` — ADT with constructors `JsonNull`, `JsonBool(Bool)`, `JsonNumber(Float)`, `JsonString(Str)`, `JsonArray(Json, Json)` (head/tail list), `JsonObject(Str, Json, Json)` (key/value/rest list)
- `parse(text)` returning `Result(Str, Json)` — parse a JSON string
- `stringify(value)` returning `Str` — serialize a JSON value to a string
- Accessor helpers: `getBool`, `getNumber`, `getString`, `getArray`, `getField`, `isNull`, `isBool`, `isNumber`, `isString`, `isArray`, `isObject`

### `Ashes.Rpc`

Stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 Content-Length framing for LSP/DAP transports.

- `readMessage()` returning `Result(Str, Str)` — read one framed message from stdin (reads the `Content-Length:` header, then exactly that many bytes via `Ashes.IO.readExact`)
- `writeMessage(msg)` returning `Unit` — write a framed message to stdout with a `Content-Length:` header

### `Ashes.Regex`

Backtracking regular-expression engine with a combinator API.

- **Type**: `Regex` — opaque pattern value
- Pattern builders: `literal(s)`, `anyChar`, `anyOf(chars)`, `noneOf(chars)`, `digit`, `letter`, `whitespace`, `seq(a)(b)`, `alt(a)(b)`, `star(r)`, `plus(r)`, `optional(r)`, `capture(r)`
- `matches(pattern)(text)` returning `Bool` — true if the pattern matches anywhere in `text`
- `find(pattern)(text)` returning `Maybe(Str)` — return the first matching substring
- `findAll(pattern)(text)` returning `List(Str)` — return all non-overlapping matches
- `replace(pattern)(replacement)(text)` returning `Str` — replace all matches

### `Ashes.Test`

- `assertEqual(expected, actual)` returning `Unit` — panic with an assertion failure unless `expected == actual`
- `fail(message)` returning `a` — abort with `message`; never returns, so it is usable at any type

`assertEqual(expected, actual)` is the preferred surface form. Like other
multi-argument calls in Ashes, it is syntax sugar for curried application.

Canonical example:

```ash
import Ashes.Test

let checked = assertEqual(3, 3)
in Ashes.IO.print("ok")
```

`Ashes.Test` is ordinary shipped library code, not a special compiler intrinsic.
