# Self-Hosting: Building the Ashes Compiler in Ashes

Status as of 2026-08-13. This is a capability audit of what Ashes-the-language, its compiler/runtime,
and its standard library must provide before a compiler can be written in Ashes. It deliberately does
not track how much of the compiler has been ported, port milestones, or bootstrap progress. See
[FUTURE_FEATURES.md](FUTURE_FEATURES.md) for how self-hosting fits the broader roadmap.

## Language/stdlib prerequisites

`Required` means Ashes still needs a design or implementation. An area tag names the eventual
consumer, not the project that must implement the prerequisite. Tests are required for every
delivered change. `Complete` capabilities link to the normative documentation for the shipped
surface; `Partial`, `Required`, and `Design required` capabilities link to actionable Ashes work
packages below.

Registry/package commands, LSP, DAP, TestRunner, fuzz-harness parity, bootstrap staging, persistent
sets, generic hashing, and a named text builder are not missing Ashes prerequisites. They may become
separate port or optimization work later, but are outside this capability audit until a concrete
language/runtime/stdlib blocker is demonstrated.

## Capability gaps and work packages

Each package below is the implementation hand-off for one or more incomplete rows in the table. A
package must add or specify an Ashes capability; work that only ports compiler code does not belong
here. Update the normative documentation before any language or API implementation.

### Gap: host-tool filesystem and process control

Single-file frontend experiments need only `readText`, but a compatible compiler must discover
projects, normalize paths, walk source roots, find its shipped `lib/` and runtime assets, create output
directories, write temporary files, and mark Linux output executable. The surrounding tools also need
stderr and controlled exit codes so a user compilation error is not reported as a language `panic`.

Add these as ordinary capability-tracked host APIs rather than ad-hoc compiler externals. Keep path
operations pure; filesystem acquisition and mutation carry `FileRead`/`FileWrite`, environment lookup
gets an explicit ambient-authority classification, and possession-based file-handle operations remain
unchanged.

Workable tasks:

1. Add a portable executable-permission operation that sets the required Unix mode bits and is a
   documented no-op or equivalent on Windows.
2. Add stderr writes and controlled process termination without turning expected compiler failures
   into `panic`; preserve cleanup of live resources on ordinary error-return paths.
3. Exercise the APIs with Ashes integration programs that discover a project fixture, locate assets
   from an installed-layout fixture, and atomically create output on Linux and Windows hosts.

Done when an Ashes program launched outside the repository can locate installed-layout fixtures,
atomically write an executable file, report an expected failure on stderr, and return a controlled
exit code on Linux and Windows.
